## Description
**Fight For Universe: Final Expedition** is a mod that extends original **Stationeers** in many different ways.

## Features
**Mount Everything on Walls**: 
 - No more need to build frame, to place/mount all things - wall is more then enough for it. 
 - Clicking "PrecisionPlace" key while placing object will allow you to re-align item to the wall. 
 - Holding "PrecisionPlace" key will allow you to ignore placement restriction and place object anyway.

**Reworked Vending Machine**:
 - While holding "QuantityModifier" key, interact with arrows to access simplified inventory list.
 - Will show exact amount of items in selected stack when hovering over intractable arrows.
 - Simplified inventory list will switch only to the first available slot with chosen item.

**Reworked Hash Generator**:
 - Fixed search list, where now everything is sorted properly, when you searching for items.
 - No longer requires screwdriver to access item list and select something.
 - Screwdriver is only required, when you want to adjust search list to any production facility on the network.
